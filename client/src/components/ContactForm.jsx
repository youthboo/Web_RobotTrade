            <h1>Payment Conditions for Robot Trade Website</h1>
            <br/>
            <p>Our robot trade website offers a straightforward payment process to ensure convenience for our users. All you need to do is enter your email and click, making payment hassle-free.</p>
            <br />
            <p>However, it's crucial to note the payment terms outlined by our platform. At the end of each month, users are required to settle their commission fees. Failure to do so within a grace period of 2 weeks into the following month will result in the suspension of bot usage.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Please be aware that if commission fees remain unpaid, access to your account will be restricted. Only after settling the outstanding commission fees will your account be reinstated for further usage.</p>

            <br />
            <p>We value transparency and fairness in our payment policies to maintain a trusted and reliable trading environment for all users. Should you have any questions or require assistance regarding payments, feel free to reach out to our customer support team.</p>
